This blog is where I share some tips and articles regarding software development that I've learned through my professional life.

I currently work at SoftwareONE as a Software Developer. My current study list includes Go, TypeScript, Docker and Artificial Intelligence. 

I also maintain an open source feedback platform called Fider. Learn more about it at [http://getfider.com](http://getfider.com)
