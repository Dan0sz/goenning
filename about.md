I'm Guilherme Oenning, a passionate software developer living in Brazil. I've worked with web development since the beginning of my career and now mostly interested on node.js, but I've done plenty of C# and Java code before. Avid practitioner of Test-Driven Development and currently learning Docker and TypeScript.

While not coding I like to go out for a run or a bike ride. Traveling has also been one of the best experiences I ever had, so I try to do it whenever I can.

You can find me online on <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.footer-links.github }}">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.footer-links.twitter }}">Twitter</a>.
